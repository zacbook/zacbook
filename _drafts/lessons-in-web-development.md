In an attempt to learn more about HTML, CSS, and using Jekyll, I started creating [ZacBook.net](http://zacbook.net) from scratch. Along the way—usually after some Googling—I learned a few things. In no particular order, here are some of them that may be useful for others (or myself) in the future:

- In Jekyll (v. 3.3.1), posts by default do not receive a `post.title` YAML / Liquid variable. However, if one creates a posts `collection` in their `_config.yml`, then `post.title` will be set to the filename of the post (without the extension). 
- Search engines typically truncate the `name="description"` HTML metadata at [160 characters](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description). This is why many Jekyll templates employ the `truncate: 160` Liquid filter.
- If you want search engines to only list one version of your URL (say, without the index.html), take advantage of the [`rel="canonical' element](https://yoast.com/rel-canonical/).
- Some / older browsers indicate, usually through an icon in the address bar, that a site has an RSS or Atom feed. It's probably nice to take advantage of this using the [`rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"' element](http://www.femgeek.co.uk/typeapplicationrssxml-where-for-are-thou/), even though [RSS is dead](https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/13/rss-is-not-not-not-not-not-dead/).
- Many Jekyll themes add both `categories` and `tags` to posts or pages. While they may seem redundant, you can make good use of them through [their subtle different meanings](https://en.support.wordpress.com/posts/categories-vs-tags/). Punchline: `categories` can be used for broad topic groupings whereas `tags` can be used like keywords.
- One an use the [HTML5Shiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Shiv) to compensate for [Internet Explorer 8's limitations](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_browsers.asp). Just add

``` html
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html5shiv/3.7.3/html5shiv.js"></script>
  <![endif]-->
```
to your `head`. Along the same lines, even though [it's probably not required](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6771258/what-does-meta-http-equiv-x-ua-compatible-content-ie-edge-do), stick 

``` html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
in there as well, close to the top.
- You can put your CSS files anywhere, `/css/main.css` seems pretty popular.
- While probably best handled via CSS, one should appropriately [set the viewport](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp) to be friendly to mobile browsers. It's as easy as adding

``` html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
to your `head`. Here's some [further elaboration](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/quick-tip-dont-forget-the-viewport-meta-tag--webdesign-5972).
- Even though I've known about [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) for several years. I didn't realize it was developed at [Shopfiy](https://www.shopify.com). Props to them!
