## Octopress configuration settings
# Default extension for new posts and pages
post_ext: md
page_ext: md

# Default templates for posts and pages
# Found in _templates/
post_layout: post
page_layout: page

# Format titles with titlecase?
titlecase: true

# Change default template file (in _templates/)
post_template: post
page_template: page
draft_template: draft

## Dev notes
# - Update extra components such as font-awesome, bootstrap, and jquery
# - Revisit mathjax config and pandoc processing, seems that $$ gets turned into mathml tags. Check drz.ac blog posts.
# - Decide if the /pages/ directory is a good idea versus manual placement?
# - Search box
#   Can generalize to allow page / post authors with
#   {% if page.author %} {% assign author = site.data.authors[page.author] %}{% else %}{% assign author = site.owner %} {% endif %}

## CSS Issues
# - CSS on archive page (from leonids) or use template from jekyll-clean
# - CSS on share boxes at the end of posts (from leonids)
# - CSS style on feature images (from leonids)
# - CSS on the contact page (link shown in small view when social icons not shown in nav bar)
# - On mobile: perhaps a better way to display social button links
