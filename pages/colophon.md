I strive to make ZacBook.net adhere to modern web standards. As such, this site should [validate as HTML 5](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fzacbook.net).

This website is powered by the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) static site generator. 

I stole ideas and code from various places:
- Renyuan's [Leonids Jekyll Theme](https://renyuanz.github.io/leonids/)
- The [HTML5 Boilerplate Project](http://www.html5boilerplate.com)
- The [Minima Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)

And I use great free and open source resources:
- [Font Awesome](http://www.fontawesome.io), for various vector icons and graphics
- [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress), for managing [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and deploying to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org), for beautifully rendered mathematics
